            <div class="excerpt-text">
                <p>Buzzards swept out of the big desert sky. The birds had been cruising for a few minutes. When they came down, I knew that something out there was dead.</p>

                <p>I was about a half mile away, walking off track, boots crunching on rocks and the hard plants that grow there. The buzzards were black specks in the sky. It was hot, maybe the hottest day of the year. I was in Big Bend National Park, Texas, a stone's throw from the Mexican border. It took me around ten minutes to get into the hills. I was sweating hard by the time I clambered up the valley to a hillside pocked with shaded crevices.</p>

                <p>I found the body wedged between boulders at the entrance to a shallow overhang. There were around two dozen buzzards on the corpse. The birds scattered when I approached, but stuck around, waiting for the chance to get back in there.</p>

                <p>The dead guy had survived into his thirties. It looked as though death had come as a major surprise. His mouth was gaping, the eyes open wide. The color had gone out of him already, so his skin was pasty and yellow. Flies buzzed around an exposed wound on his head and in and out of his mouth and nostrils, settling down on his eyeballs.</p>

                <p>I squatted down to inspect the wound.</p>

                <p>The skull was fractured and the broken bone was pushed inward. But the broken off pieces had fragmented after the first impact, which meant repeated blows. This was not an accidental death. The guy had not fallen onto his head from a cliff. Neither had he been pushed out of an airplane. No giant had picked him up and flung him down to earth. He had been murdered. Recently. The blood was sticky, not yet dry. Straight black hair was still plastered to his head with sweat. The buzzards had only just begun to feed.</p>

                <p>A couple of feet away from the body was a black baseball cap with an embroidered Chihuahua on the front. I figured it had gotten knocked off when his skull was caved in by someone holding the bloodied, grapefruit-sized rock at rest near the body. I looked at the murder weapon and pictured the hand that had held it. It occurred to me that the person to whom that hand belonged was still around. So, I stood up straight, took a good look around and called out, "Hello," and then, "Hola." But the only thing I got in return was my own voice, echoed back by the stubborn hillside.</p>

                <p class="scene-break">* * *</p>

                <p>Hiking under the Texas sun had not been a pre-meditated plan, like a vacation or a retreat. It had happened by way of several interconnected events and personalities.</p>

                <p>I had been out on Vancouver Island for a couple of weeks, helping Steve Bell harvest Gooseneck barnacles off rocks for the Japanese buyers. A Gooseneck barnacle is a type of seafood, like a clam or lobster, but attached to rocks. Americans don't eat many of them. We think they look alien, not like good eating. But, the folks in Japan, Spain, and Portugal think of them as very good eating. What's more, they have eaten up their own supply. Steve had cottoned on to this, and set himself up as an exporter. Steve had needed help with his new venture, so I figured helping him was the right thing to do.</p>

                <p>Now he was doing alright. Gooseneck barnacles are seriously hard to get, and seriously expensive. Good for Steve, okay for me. Steve's business had picked up, and I was glad to help a friend. On top of that, he paid me. The water off Vancouver Island is cold all year round, and the sea spray in your face is bracing. In the beginning there had been a Swedish girl involved. But by the time Steve had come around to mentioning the situation with Mallory, the Swedish girl was gone.</p>

                <p>We were in the truck driving back from the spot. Steve was never a big talker, and I'm fine with that. So, it was really out of nowhere that Steve said, "You heard about Mallory, right?"</p>

                <p>I had not heard about anything, or spoken to anyone. Hadn't even thought about Mallory in years. The last time I'd seen her was in Northeast Syria, through a swirling storm of rotor dust as she lifted the Pave Hawk helicopter out of a hot landing zone. Mallory had glanced at me, making eye contact. My team was already taking fire. Thirty seconds later the chopper was out of sight and out of mind.</p>

                <p>"No Steve, I didn't hear about Mallory. What about her?"</p>

                <p>Steve had been driving along, quietly looking through the windshield at the road, watching it curve along the jagged coastline. He said, "Brain cancer. Three months, max. She asked about you. That was about a month and a half ago."</p>

                <p>The first thing that came to mind was the meaning of her name, Mallory, which means <em>unfortunate</em> in French. My mother was born in France, and I speak the language.</p>

                <p>"Sorry to hear that."</p>

                <p>"Yeah. It sucks."</p>

                <p>"How's she taking it?"</p>

                <p>Steve hadn't actually spoken to Mallory, or seen her in person. The conversation had been conducted over the internet, in something called a group chat, apparently by text message, with the use of thumbs. He said, "I don't know. How does anyone take that? I guess badly, but bravely."</p>

                <p>"I guess so, knowing Mallory."</p>

                <p>Mallory had been a combat search and rescue pilot attached to the 322nd Special Tactics Squadron, which was me and Steve and a bunch of other operators. She was brave, that was for damn sure. It didn't take long for me to process the fact that she had terminal cancer and wanted to see me. If Mallory wanted to see me, I was going to show up. Period.</p>

                <p>I packed my bag that night and hit the road early the next morning. Flew from Vancouver to San Antonio via Los Angeles. From San Antonio, I picked up a blue Ford rental car for the five-hour drive west to Twin Forks, Mallory's home town. It was after midnight by the time I got in to Twin Forks. The town was an eerie bunch of lights in a featureless desert night with no moon. I found a spot to pull off the road, racked the seat back, and closed my eyes.</p>
